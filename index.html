                                    <li>Started as part of a course and on the basis of professor Böhmer's idea, we work on a novel task, <i>observation robustness</i>, where an agent's state is temporarily inaccessible, but the agent must keep solving a task (here, finding its way through a maze).</li>
                                    <li>We frame this as an open-loop control task, and contribute the first open-loop loss applied to online deep reinforcement learning. Our agent not only successfully becomes robust, but generalises to longer open-loop timespans than it was trained on.</li>
                                    <li>I mainly contributed to codebase design, experimental setup, and final experiment decisions, as well as the writing of the paper.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <li><strong>(2022) Research Project:</strong> Achieved 9.5 grade on quantum computing project implementing variational eigensolver on QuTech's 5-Qubit quantum computer</li>

                                    <li>As part of the Quantum Science and Information Minor at the prestigious QuTech insitute within the Factulty of Applied Sciences and under professor <a href="https://qutech.nl/person/menno-veldhorst/">Menno Veldhorst</a> who was part of the first team to ever show universal quantum logic in silicon, I was part of a 5-person team implementing a variational eigensolver from research running for the first time on a TU Delft quantum computer.</li>
                                    <li>We were praised for the high quality of the results despite being a team of computer scientists with only one physics student, as well as the quality of our analysis of the results.</li>
                                    <li>As this was done within the challenging Quantum Science and Information minor, which is not recommended for Computer Science students due to its difficulty, I learned a lot about the physicist's way of solving and framing challenging problems.</li>
                                </ul>

                                        <li>This was part of the Computer Vision course of my Msc degree.</li>
                                        <li>Given the semantic nature of the DINOv2 model's loss, we wanted to know if enough positional information was present to use it to improve on the state of the art in a small benchmark gesture recognition dataset. This was achieved successfully.</li>
                                        <li>I was responsible for designing the experimental setup, generating results and the subsequent write-up.</li>

                                    <li>took leadership of a team of 5 students serving as software engineers and oversaw their work</li>
                                    <li>attracted a proposal for collaboration from the Technologico de Monterrey university which sought to partner with TU Delft at large</li>

                                    <li>quickly acquire domain-specific knowledge from developers to help them in finding solutions to domain-specific problems (we had a LiDAR-processing and serving team, a web-interface and 3D rendering team, and a web-networking + data streaming + peer-to-peer connection management team which I was mainly working on)</li>
                                    <li>conduct market research in software solutions and compare available options, evaluate them based on project requirements</li>

                                <li>initially an internship turned into full employment, I was their first Data Scientist and eventually oversaw the work of their second data science hire, all under supervision by CTO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eriktromp/">Erik Tromp</a></li>
                                <li>I developed the company's data science pipeline, which processes a job vacancy to generate annotations and text-level metrics highlighting socio-economic biases and overall quality of the text</li>
                                <li>As a result of my pipeline, our platform reached the quality of established competition's metrics, and went beyond by tailoring job vacancy metrics to personality and intelligence characteristics of desired hires using governmental dataset data.</li>
                                <li>As part of their job vacancy creation tool, I built a multilingual neural search engine, able to flexibly match a job description to an officially recognised job title (i.e. "tooth doctor" or "Zahnarzt" resolves to "dentist")</li>
                                <li>as part of an ethnic bias detection system, under their CTO I trained an NLP language model on tweets containing skin-coloured emojis</li>
                                <li>largely I was left to design systems, ideate functionalities, and make advanced design decisions on my own, with CTO Erik Tromp simply overseeing results</li>
                                <li>My work led to most of their competitive advantage, causing their integration into recruitment software <a href="https://ubeeo.nl/koppelingen/cortexter/">Ubeeo</a>, <a href="https://carerix.com/en/integrations/cortexter/">Carerix</a>, and <a href="https://www.otys.com/en/partners-integrations/cortexter/">Otys</a>.</li>
